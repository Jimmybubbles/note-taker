# Challenges

Had a hard time working out that was wrong with the loading of the site. turns out the wildcard symbol in the route kills anything underneath it. Didn't know that the server cascades so that was a good thing to learn. the routing itself is pretty self explanatory.

Have to learn array manipulation more because I was struggling with that, have started to use leet code to try to drill in the manipulation of strings and then posting back what is needed to the new array. Starting to get the concepts of what to do but still working on syntax. good to see the javascript written out to see how it was coded.
